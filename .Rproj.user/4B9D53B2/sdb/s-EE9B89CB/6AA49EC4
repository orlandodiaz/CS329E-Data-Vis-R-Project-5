This notebook includes step-by-step instructions on how to reproduce our project. To obtain our data, we used data.world. Our dataset covers orders and shipment \n\n#**R Configuration**\nBelow we display our sessionInfo().\n\n```{r sessionInfo}\nsessionInfo(package=NULL)\n```\n\n#**Data Description**\nAll data were obtained through esapubs.org. The dataset, Pantheria, contains 100740 lines of biological data for extant and recently extinct mammalian species and was collect over a span of three years. All data came as one textfile, which we edited using Microsoft Excel.\n\n#**Cleaning Data**\nHere's our ETL file to clean our data set.\n\n```{r}\nsource(\"../01 Data/R_ETL.pantheria.R\")\n```\n\n#**Cleaned up Data Download**\nCleaned data can be downloaded from Data.world as a .csv file. Because the dataset is so large, we filtered to only show some rows.\n\nHosting User: jlee</br>\nDatabase: S17 DV Project 5</br>\nDataset Name: census-pop-sex.csv\n\nDownload Link: https://query.data.world/s/42bb8a11rh9kapksqyp7b7ocv\n\n```{r}\nsource(\"../01 Data/Accessdataworld4.R\")\n```\n\n#**Tableau / Tableau Action Generated Visualizations**\n**Descriptions:** Refer to visualization captions for individual descriptions.\n\n![](../03 Visualizations/LitterSizeByOrderandFamily.png)<br><br><br>\n![](../03 Visualizations/Trophiclevel.png)<br><br><br>\n![](../03 Visualizations/Adult-body-mass.png)</center>\n\n#**Shiny Visualization and Published Application**\n**Description:** A static .png of the Shiny application, as well as a link to the live published version.
