This notebook includes step-by-step instructions on how to reproduce our project. To obtain our data, we used data.world. \n\n#**R Configuration**\nBelow we display our sessionInfo().\n\n```{r sessionInfo}\nsessionInfo(package=NULL)\n```\n\n#**Data Description**\nAll data were obtained through esapubs.org. The dataset, Pantheria, contains 100740 lines of biological data for extant and recently extinct mammalian species and was collect over a span of three years. All data came as one textfile, which we edited using Microsoft Excel.\n\n#**Cleaning Data**\nHere's our ETL file to clean our data set.\n\n```{r}\nsource(\"../01 Data/R_ETL.GlobalShipments.R\")\n```\n\n#**Cleaned up Data Download**\nCleaned data can be downloaded from Data.world as a .csv file. Because the dataset is so large, we filtered to only show some rows.\n\nHosting User: jlee</br>\nDatabase: S17 DV Project 5</br>\nDataset Name: globalshipments.csv\n\nDownload Link: https://query.data.world/s/c8ebqjbjswp7vqlzgkgm5mg0g\n\n```{r}\nsource(\"../01 Data/Accessdataworld5.R\")\n```\n\n#**Tableau / Tableau Action Generated Visualizations**\n**Descriptions:** Refer to visualization captions for individual descriptions.\n\n![](../03 Visualizations/Crosstab 1 .png)<br><br><br>\n![](../03 Visualizations/Crosstab 1 Map.png)<br><br><br>\n![](../03 Visualizations/Crosstab 2 .png)</center>\n![](../03 Visualizations/Crosstab 2 Map.png)</center>\n![](../03 Visualizations/Crosstab 3 .png)</center>\n![](../03 Visualizations/Crosstab 3 Map.png)</center>\n\n#**Shiny Visualization and Published Application**\n**Description:** A static .png of the Shiny application, as well as a link to the live published version. Crosstab 1 sums up the shipping costs by segment and state. The data is filtered on Country = United States and dislays the IN of Two Highest Shipping Segments. Crosstab 2 breaks down the sum of sales by ship mode and state. The color highlights KPI - Sales per person Low to High. Again, the data is filtered on Country = United States and IN for Two Least Used Shipping Mode. Lastly, Crosstab 3 covers sum of sales by sub-category and country. KPI reflects the profit to sales ratio low to high. The data is filtered on IN for Five Highest Sub-Categories.\nPublished Link: https://frannyfang.shinyapps.io/crosstab2/ https://frannyfang.shinyapps.io/Crosstab3/ \n\n![](../03 Visualizations/Shiny2.PNG)</center>\n![](../03 Visualizations/Shiny3.PNG)</center>\n",
